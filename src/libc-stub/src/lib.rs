//! This crate is a hack and should not exist!
//!
//! Ok with that out of the way let's see what's going on here. The libsodium
//! library is compiled with a C compiler (clang) and sort of expects to link
//! against musl. In reality we compiled it in such a way that is didn't find
//! most of its functionality (aka optional symbols are all deduced to not
//! exist). We won't link to musl as musl has more of a runtime than we'd like.
//!
//! Despite this the libsodium library will still reference some global symbols
//! it expects from the C library. Things like `abort` or `__errno_location`.
//! Again, these are all defined by musl itself, but for now we're not linking
//! that in. The MUSL library currently assumes a generic `__syscall` abi which
//! is a bit unfortunate, we don't want to deal with that at all! In any case..
//!
//! So to actually get these symbols resolved so we can instantiate the module
//! at runtime the definition has to live somewhere. Currently this opts to have
//! that definition live in Rust in this crate.
//!
//! This isn't great and is a massive pain point around integration with C right
//! now. It's not clear how these symbols are to be defined on the
//! `wasm32-unknown-unknown-wasm` target in C. I at least haven't seen a lot of
//! great examples of how to use that target in C...
//!
//! More comments on each function below!
